The goal of my project is to confirm that there is a statistically significant difference between the opioid overdose rate within the Appalachian region vs outside of the region. I then want to compare this rate to the rates of the rest of the nation. Finally, I want to decipher which states have done the best job “managing” the crisis and which ones Appalachian states should model their relief initiatives after.
